## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Dockerizing the Application

Follow these steps to Dockerize and run the application:

### Step 1: Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the `project` directory and run the following command to build the Docker image:


docker build -t my-js-app .

### Step 2: Run the Docker Container

After building the image, run the container using the following command:

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 my-js-app

This command runs the container in detached mode and maps port 8080 of the host to port 8080 of the container.

### Step 3: Verify the Container is Running

You can verify that the container is running by checking the list of running containers:

docker ps

You should see an entry for `my-js-app`.

## Running the Application

To run the application locally without Docker, ensure you have Node.js installed and use the following command:

node index.js

## Notes

- The application reads from `input.txt` and writes to `output.txt`.
- Modify `index.js` as per your application logic.
